            <p>The Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited or HDFC was among the first financial institutions in
              India to receive an “in principle” approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to set up a bank in the
              private sector. This was done as part of RBI’s policy for liberalisation of the Indian banking industry in
              1994.

              HDFC Bank was incorporated in August 1994 in the name of HDFC Bank Limited, with its registered office in
              Mumbai, India. The bank commenced operations as a Scheduled Commercial Bank in January 1995.

              As of June 30, 2022, the Bank had a nationwide distribution network of 6,378 branches and 18,620 ATM's in
              3,203 cities/towns.
